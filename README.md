Airline Cancellation and Delay Dashboard
This repository contains a project aimed at analyzing and visualizing airline cancellations and delays. The project leverages Excel for data cleaning and preparation and Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard to uncover key insights.

Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are to:

Understand patterns and trends in airline delays and cancellations.
Identify key factors contributing to delays and cancellations.
Provide actionable insights to improve airline operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Tools and Technologies
Excel: For data cleaning, formatting, and preparation.
Power BI: For designing an interactive dashboard with insightful visualizations.
Key Features of the Dashboard
Flight Status Overview: Total flights, cancellations, and delays.
Delay Analysis: Average delay times categorized by airline, airport, and time of day.
Cancellation Trends: Cancellation reasons and their frequency.
Seasonal Patterns: Monthly and seasonal trends in delays and cancellations.
Performance by Airline: Comparative analysis of airlines based on delays and cancellations.
Airport Insights: Identification of airports with the highest delays and cancellations.
Project Workflow
Data Cleaning in Excel:

Removed inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors in the dataset.
Handled missing values and standardized date and time formats.
Added new columns for calculated metrics like delay duration categories (short, moderate, long).
Data Visualization in Power BI:

Imported the cleaned dataset from Excel into Power BI.
Created relationships between datasets (if applicable).
Developed visuals such as line charts, bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots to represent the data.
Used slicers for dynamic filtering by airline, airport, or time period.
Insights and Recommendations
Airline Performance: Identified airlines with the lowest delay rates and consistent on-time performance.
Peak Delay Times: Highlighted specific times or seasons with higher delay frequencies.
Airport Bottlenecks: Pinpointed airports requiring infrastructure or process improvements.
Policy Suggestions: Recommended adjustments in flight schedules and customer communication strategies.
Dashboard Preview

How to Use
Open the Excel file to view the cleaned dataset.
Open the Power BI (.pbix) file to explore the dashboard interactively.
Use filters and slicers to focus on specific airlines, airports, or time periods for a more granular analysis.
Future Enhancements
Automating data updates with Power BI service and Power Query.
Incorporating weather data for a more comprehensive analysis of delay reasons.
Adding predictive models to forecast delays based on historical data.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about:

Flights, their schedules, and statuses.
Delay durations and reasons.
Cancellations and corresponding causes.
